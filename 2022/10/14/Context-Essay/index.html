I want to present a case that non-expert clients and designers can work together for interior design at the same time and space, with the computer program of AR device joining and helping the discussion and evolve of design project simultaneously. For example, the on-site discussion and communication of interior design will involve gesture, hand pointing, verbal and eye communication, and if we can have computer recognize and process the natural input to generate design plans, and realize as virtual models and present to users as holograms, it would be of great help for the communication. By user experiments with the prototype I want to find out how will the interaction it proposed between human and computer, human and human will enforce the collaboration in design, and how it will empower the non-experts in design activity by helping them become more aware of their desired outcomes and how to precisely express in the process of interacting with the system and the designer.\nRelated WorksAugmented Reality in Design CollaborationThere currently exists several studies of collaborating on tasks in Augmented reality, and the importance of the communication and visibility of other participants is recognized[1][2][3][4]. Billinghurst’s study shows how the “shared space” in 3D computer supported collaborative work[1]. Their experiment is for two players to play the game of moving virtual objects under various experimental conditions and with different roles, and the analyze of the result supports that the performance of users in the game can be significantly improved if they can communicate in body language, and stressing the importance of the sense of existence of collaborator and word of team-working in virtual space. Also, the virtual environment is considered interesting by participants. Except for this compare of interaction circumstance, there are also research and projects focusing on the task of design, which is strongly related to my question and requires more engagement for users. Remiko and Jun presented a hand-held augmented reality system for collaborative design early in 1996[2]. By holding a display, the users can see the virtual object in real space through the screen. It supports significantly 100 users in the same time, but the disadvantage is also obvious, only one user can have the ownership to move the object, and the eye and gesture communication among users is limited by the hand held display. Then in 1999[3], Kiyikawa et al presented a system for sharing seamlessly integrated VR and AR experience in design. Users can communicate with others in AR and switch to VR for scaling virtual objects or changing arbitrary perspective. The study of its experiments shows that being able to obstruct each others physically makes it preferable in AR in the aspect of task completing time and subjective evaluation. This system did not support some movement and sharing the view of virtual object that larger than a desk size. More close to the case my proposal is considering, Wang’s study[4] presented a mixed reality scenario for designers and customers to collaborate. With the computer-meditated telepresence system, it tried to extend the boundary of mixed reality system, providing the circumstance that designer’s work can be shared and managed while collaborating. The system it presents to me is unnecessarily complicate without integrating the sensors and applying too much markers, but it provided a detailed analysis of boundaries, and explored the potentials of distributed collaborative design.\nAR InteractionTo provide friendly experience of human-computer interaction and human-human interaction in AR environment, current research already explored the aspects of visualizing virtual object[5][6][7][8], touchless[7] and tangible[8] interaction, as well as audiovisual experience[9]. Displaying information interface that fit the real environment and human movement is an interesting question and Lages et al [5] developed a walkable system for massive of information to display and adaptive to user’s orientation and orientation. The virtual windows adapts to nearby walls, follows user’s movement and rotation and detects collision, also supports real-time interaction. Its user study shows that the auto-following is the most preferable feature, and auto-centering is considered easy to use. And it suggests that for interface in AR we should consider the layout management, information availability and harmony to real world.How to seamlessly control the virtual object with multi users AR experience is also worth study for collaboration. In Regenbrecht’s work[6], the seamless multi user interaction is realized with a “clipping” tool that will work for both users with high-quality rendering, also it is well in locating object with the marker. It combines different technology to enable users share a seamless control of virtual 2d or 3d object, but also it limits the interaction with the locating method and the “clipping” tool and method.Touch-less gesture recognition and interface in AR is helpful for investigate tasks that limits the user’s interact with real objects. Datcu’s research [7] applies active appearance model for hand keypoints to enable hand gesture detections and 3d pointing. The interact they designed is considered easy to learn, but also can be stressful and physical demanding for users.Tangible interaction in AR is also worth considering. According to Billinghurst’s research [8], natural reaction, faster response that provided by tangible interface is superior for interaction with virtual objects.\nUser Experience Study for ARCurrent studies around user experience in AR concerns the joint attention of users, acceptance, social interactions and psychological ownership. Schnier’s study[9] considered how to establish joint attention towards the same object or referent in the case of museum exhibition design. The system they proposed use tangible model interface to manipulate virtual objects, and found that coordinate would be sensitive to the stability, embodiment and interaction organization. Ownership of sharing environment is studied under the aspect of interact circumstance and device. Carrozzi’s research [10] tests how the availability to modify hologram, sharing experience or device with another user would influence psychological ownership. In the result it shows psychological ownership of AR holograms can invoke customers’ social identity needs for assimilation and differentiation. A relative research by Poretski [11] concerns the social implications acceptance of shared AR, presenting the case that present AR artifacts based on human body, home or possessions. It aims to fond out how control and regulation of user power can prevent violation of psychological ownership, identity and personal space.\ntbc\nNoveltyReference[1] Billinghurst, M., S.

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>My research question will be around how to improve design collaboration with Augmented Reality. I want to present a case that non-expert clients and designers can work together for interior design at the same time and space, with the computer program of AR device joining and helping the discussion and evolve of design project simultaneously. For example, the on-site discussion and communication of interior design will involve gesture, hand pointing, verbal and eye communication, and if we can have computer recognize and process the natural input to generate design plans, and realize as virtual models and present to users as holograms, it would be of great help for the communication. By user experiments with the prototype I want to find out how will the interaction it proposed between human and computer, human and human will enforce the collaboration in design, and how it will empower the non-experts in design activity by helping them become more aware of their desired outcomes and how to precisely express in the process of interacting with the system and the designer.</p>
<h2 id="Related-Works"><a href="#Related-Works" class="headerlink" title="Related Works"></a>Related Works</h2><h3 id="Augmented-Reality-in-Design-Collaboration"><a href="#Augmented-Reality-in-Design-Collaboration" class="headerlink" title="Augmented Reality in Design Collaboration"></a>Augmented Reality in Design Collaboration</h3><p>There currently exists several studies of collaborating on tasks in Augmented reality, and the importance of the communication and visibility of other participants is recognized[1][2][3][4]. Billinghurst’s study shows how the “shared space” in 3D computer supported collaborative work[1]. Their experiment is for two players to play the game of moving virtual objects under various experimental conditions and with different roles, and the analyze of the result supports that the performance of users in the game can be significantly improved if they can communicate in body language, and stressing the importance of the sense of existence of collaborator and word of team-working in virtual space. Also, the virtual environment is considered interesting by participants. Except for this compare of interaction circumstance, there are also research and projects focusing on the task of design, which is strongly related to my question and requires more engagement for users. Remiko and Jun presented a hand-held augmented reality system for collaborative design early in 1996[2]. By holding a display, the users can see the virtual object in real space through the screen. It supports significantly 100 users in the same time, but the disadvantage is also obvious, only one user can have the ownership to move the object, and the eye and gesture communication among users is limited by the hand held display. Then in 1999[3], Kiyikawa et al presented a system for sharing seamlessly integrated VR and AR experience in design. Users can communicate with others in AR and switch to VR for scaling virtual objects or changing arbitrary perspective. The study of its experiments shows that being able to obstruct each others physically makes it preferable in AR in the aspect of task completing time and subjective evaluation. This system did not support some movement and sharing the view of virtual object that larger than a desk size. More close to the case my proposal is considering, Wang’s study[4] presented a mixed reality scenario for designers and customers to collaborate. With the computer-meditated telepresence system, it tried to extend the boundary of mixed reality system, providing the circumstance that designer’s work can be shared and managed while collaborating. The system it presents to me is unnecessarily complicate without integrating the sensors and applying too much markers, but it provided a detailed analysis of boundaries, and explored the potentials of distributed collaborative design.</p>
<h3 id="AR-Interaction"><a href="#AR-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="AR Interaction"></a>AR Interaction</h3><p>To provide friendly experience of human-computer interaction and human-human interaction in AR environment, current research already explored the aspects of visualizing virtual object[5][6][7][8], touchless[7] and tangible[8] interaction, as well as audiovisual experience[9]. Displaying information interface that fit the real environment and human movement is an interesting question and Lages et al [5] developed a walkable system for massive of information to display and adaptive to user’s orientation and orientation. The virtual windows adapts to nearby walls, follows user’s movement and rotation and detects collision, also supports real-time interaction. Its user study shows that the auto-following is the most preferable feature, and auto-centering is considered easy to use. And it suggests that for interface in AR we should consider the layout management, information availability and harmony to real world.<br>How to seamlessly control the virtual object with multi users AR experience is also worth study for collaboration. In Regenbrecht’s work[6], the seamless multi user interaction is realized with a “clipping” tool that will work for both users with high-quality rendering, also it is well in locating object with the marker. It combines different technology to enable users share a seamless control of virtual 2d or 3d object, but also it limits the interaction with the locating method and the “clipping” tool and method.<br>Touch-less gesture recognition and interface in AR is helpful for investigate tasks that limits the user’s interact with real objects. Datcu’s research [7] applies active appearance model for hand keypoints to enable hand gesture detections and 3d pointing. The interact they designed is considered easy to learn, but also can be stressful and physical demanding for users.<br>Tangible interaction in AR is also worth considering. According to Billinghurst’s research [8], natural reaction, faster response that provided by tangible interface is superior for interaction with virtual objects.</p>
<h3 id="User-Experience-Study-for-AR"><a href="#User-Experience-Study-for-AR" class="headerlink" title="User Experience Study for AR"></a>User Experience Study for AR</h3><p>Current studies around user experience in AR concerns the joint attention of users, acceptance, social interactions and psychological ownership. Schnier’s study[9] considered how to establish joint attention towards the same object or referent in the case of museum exhibition design. The system they proposed use tangible model interface to manipulate virtual objects, and found that coordinate would be sensitive to the stability, embodiment and interaction organization. Ownership of sharing environment is studied under the aspect of interact circumstance and device. Carrozzi’s research [10] tests how the availability to modify hologram, sharing experience or device with another user would influence psychological ownership. In the result it shows psychological ownership of AR holograms can invoke customers’ social identity needs for assimilation and differentiation. A relative research by Poretski [11] concerns the social implications acceptance of shared AR, presenting the case that present AR artifacts based on human body, home or possessions. It aims to fond out how control and regulation of user power can prevent violation of psychological ownership, identity and personal space.</p>
