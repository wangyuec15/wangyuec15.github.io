The project presence such a vision, when non-expert clients need to complete some interior design task, they can work with a designer at the specific place. Through the AR application, they can have a realistic preview of the interior design outcome, and explore design variations by moving the furniture models by gesture and UI interaction. When users discussing about the design plan, the system will detect the keywords in their speech, and run a machine learning algorithm to suggest possible actions to users. Through the system, users can have an intuitive understanding about design expectations and can communicate their ideas more accurately with designers via the supported interactions. The aid of computer intelligence can also provide users with design ideas. I hope that this approach can empower users who have no prior knowledge of interior design to create designs that meet their own needs.\nAugmented reality technology can be useful for presenting virtual data in a realistic environment, for interaction and visualization. This proposal suggests the interaction of multiple people in AR to present a future way of working with virtual data and interacting with it, mapping to the real world. One of the important issues is to get a consensus on the existence and changes of objects in the virtual world among different users. Another aspect worth studying is applying computer intelligence in it, with the help of existing technologies, to involve computers in human life and communication, becoming part of the participation and decision-making to solve real-world problems. Overall, I want to show a scenario of design communication and collaboration where people interact in overlapping virtual and real worlds, and present and communicate their vision of space by modifying virtual objects. In this scenario, the computer acts not only as an agent to realize the user’s input, but also as a participant to offer suggestions based on the communication between users.\nThere is some existing research that explores how to make designs collaboratively in AR environments. For example, Billinghurst’s research and Kiyikawa’s project considered design in the co-present context as I did, but without taking full advantage of the potential of augmented reality to change people’s spatial experience, limiting the operating space to a smaller area such as the desktop. Wang’s mixed reality system and Phan’s project for interior design are good exploration of AR space, while using markers for positioning or applying multiple sensors for taking human input makes the interactions more complex and less convenient. I propose to integrate the interaction of this project in a head-mounted AR device, and assist it with machine learning to help make design operations in augmented reality more intuitive and enhance computer intelligence in communication.\nI will explore a collaborative design scenario in which multiple people are co-present, using speech recognition, gesture interaction and machine learning recommendation techniques. Attempt to explore interaction that can better fit human communication behavior in the real world, and evaluate the results by collecting user data and interviews. Imagine two users are going to furnish their office, and while they discuss “what color should the couch be” and “where should we put the desk”, they can have a direct view of their expected design results in the space, so that they can efficiently communicate and achieve the desired design.\nPrototype Develop ProgressTo achieve the functionality of the proposed prototype, there are several aspects that should be realized. \nModel modificationMoveWith the MRTK plugin, I tried close hand interaction and ray pointer with pinch for moving digital models. I think pinch movement is a more suitable interaction method because in larger sites it reduces the need for human walking, allows easier manipulation, and enables a global view when handling big object models. In addition, depending on the properties of the object, there are certain restrictions on the movement operation, such as attach to the ground or on the wall, avoid collision with room boundaries and other models, etc. I will expand on this further in the following section about spatial understanding.\n\nRotateThe common operation of rotating an object is either with one contact around an axis, or with two contacts. One-handed operation would be easier for users, but it requires to be distinguished from moving operations. Using UI and voice control are both more convenient methods to switch. Voice recognition takes longer response time while UI switching is more intuitive, so here we switch one-handed rotation or movement operations through augmented reality touchable UI.\n\nApply MaterialChanging the color or texture of furniture is also a common operation in interior design tasks. In order to allow the user to arrange different materials for the digital model, the corresponding UI can be applied to provide possible material options when the item is selected. This feature is still in the process of development.\nSpatial UnderstandingIn interior design scenarios, the real world can be restrictive to the design, so it is also important to detect the actual environment and correspond to the virtual space. Microsoft provides a real-time spatial detection plugin that can determine walls and planes in the environment. However, its drawback lies in the inability to accurately detect small surfaces and transparent objects, and it requires excessive computation, so this is not the most ideal solution. The alternative is to use the hololens device’s environment modeling function to obtain data of the environment in advance, and place it into the virtual setup, which can make the interaction process more effective and responsive to the environment.\n\nSpeech RecognitionBy applying the speech recognition, we can convert the speech to text in real time. I tried both speech recognition and keyword detection. Speech recognition converts all voice over a period of time into text, enabling developers to perform text-based processing based on it, but this approach takes up significant memory and computation power. If keyword detection is used, it can identify whether predefined keywords are referred to and we can then determine the meaning of the language based on the order the keywords recognized. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is not scalable. In the scope of thesis, we need to allocate more arithmetic power to achieve speedy responses, so I will keep trying use keyword detection to identify the intent behind user conversations.\nExperiment DesignA participant with no interior design skills and a designer were placed together in an empty room of about 40 m2. They were given 5 minutes to experience the CoDeAR tutorial and familiarize themselves with the interactions. The participant is then asked to try to design a room for themselves in collaboration with the designer within 20 minutes. The program would record the participants’ movements, interactions and keyword trigger times. At the end of the experiment, a 15-minute semi-structured interview was conducted to understand the participants’ attitudes towards AR-assisted design collaboration, interaction methods, and recommendation systems. \nExpected OutcomeThe main focus of the experiment was whether users found the prototype interactions easy to learn and use, whether they found it comfortable to communicate with designers, and how they felt about the involvement of computer intelligence.\n","dateCreated":"2022-11-09T13:42:41-05:00","dateModified":"2022-12-07T20:03:04-05:00","datePublished":"2022-11-09T13:42:41-05:00","description":"In this report, I am going to introduce the prototype and experiment I designed for the thesis project.","headline":"Pre-thesis Research Report","image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://example.com/2022/11/09/Pre-thesis-Research-Report/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yuechen Wang","sameAs":["https://github.com/","http://stackoverflow.com/users","https://twitter.com/","https://facebook.com/","https://plus.google.com/","https://www.linkedin.com/profile/","mailto"],"image":"author.jpg","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"author.jpg"}},"url":"http://example.com/2022/11/09/Pre-thesis-Research-Report/","keywords":"pre-thesis"}</script>

            <p>In this report, I am going to introduce the prototype and experiment I designed for the thesis project.</p>
<span id="more"></span> 
<h2 id="Prototype-Design"><a href="#Prototype-Design" class="headerlink" title="Prototype Design"></a>Prototype Design</h2><p>CoDeAR is an AR system that support users to share the view and modification of virtual objects, and to complete interior design tasks on the site. The project presence such a vision, when non-expert clients need to complete some interior design task, they can work with a designer at the specific place. Through the AR application, they can have a realistic preview of the interior design outcome, and explore design variations by moving the furniture models by gesture and UI interaction. When users discussing about the design plan, the system will detect the keywords in their speech, and run a machine learning algorithm to suggest possible actions to users. Through the system, users can have an intuitive understanding about design expectations and can communicate their ideas more accurately with designers via the supported interactions. The aid of computer intelligence can also provide users with design ideas. I hope that this approach can empower users who have no prior knowledge of interior design to create designs that meet their own needs.</p>
<p>Augmented reality technology can be useful for presenting virtual data in a realistic environment, for interaction and visualization. This proposal suggests the interaction of multiple people in AR to present a future way of working with virtual data and interacting with it, mapping to the real world. One of the important issues is to get a consensus on the existence and changes of objects in the virtual world among different users. Another aspect worth studying is applying computer intelligence in it, with the help of existing technologies, to involve computers in human life and communication, becoming part of the participation and decision-making to solve real-world problems. Overall, I want to show a scenario of design communication and collaboration where people interact in overlapping virtual and real worlds, and present and communicate their vision of space by modifying virtual objects. In this scenario, the computer acts not only as an agent to realize the user’s input, but also as a participant to offer suggestions based on the communication between users.</p>
<p>There is some existing research that explores how to make designs collaboratively in AR environments. For example, Billinghurst’s research and Kiyikawa’s project considered design in the co-present context as I did, but without taking full advantage of the potential of augmented reality to change people’s spatial experience, limiting the operating space to a smaller area such as the desktop. Wang’s mixed reality system and Phan’s project for interior design are good exploration of AR space, while using markers for positioning or applying multiple sensors for taking human input makes the interactions more complex and less convenient. I propose to integrate the interaction of this project in a head-mounted AR device, and assist it with machine learning to help make design operations in augmented reality more intuitive and enhance computer intelligence in communication.</p>
<p>I will explore a collaborative design scenario in which multiple people are co-present, using speech recognition, gesture interaction and machine learning recommendation techniques. Attempt to explore interaction that can better fit human communication behavior in the real world, and evaluate the results by collecting user data and interviews. Imagine two users are going to furnish their office, and while they discuss “what color should the couch be” and “where should we put the desk”, they can have a direct view of their expected design results in the space, so that they can efficiently communicate and achieve the desired design.</p>
<h2 id="Prototype-Develop-Progress"><a href="#Prototype-Develop-Progress" class="headerlink" title="Prototype Develop Progress"></a>Prototype Develop Progress</h2><p>To achieve the functionality of the proposed prototype, there are several aspects that should be realized. </p>
<h3 id="Model-modification"><a href="#Model-modification" class="headerlink" title="Model modification"></a>Model modification</h3><h4 id="Move"><a href="#Move" class="headerlink" title="Move"></a>Move</h4><p>With the MRTK plugin, I tried close hand interaction and ray pointer with pinch for moving digital models. I think pinch movement is a more suitable interaction method because in larger sites it reduces the need for human walking, allows easier manipulation, and enables a global view when handling big object models. In addition, depending on the properties of the object, there are certain restrictions on the movement operation, such as attach to the ground or on the wall, avoid collision with room boundaries and other models, etc. I will expand on this further in the following section about spatial understanding.</p>
<p><img src="/images/thesisrep/1/move.pn" alt="move object"></p>
<h4 id="Rotate"><a href="#Rotate" class="headerlink" title="Rotate"></a>Rotate</h4><p>The common operation of rotating an object is either with one contact around an axis, or with two contacts. One-handed operation would be easier for users, but it requires to be distinguished from moving operations. Using UI and voice control are both more convenient methods to switch. Voice recognition takes longer response time while UI switching is more intuitive, so here we switch one-handed rotation or movement operations through augmented reality touchable UI.</p>
<p><img src="/images/thesisrep/1/rotate.png" alt="rotate object"></p>
<h4 id="Apply-Material"><a href="#Apply-Material" class="headerlink" title="Apply Material"></a>Apply Material</h4><p>Changing the color or texture of furniture is also a common operation in interior design tasks. In order to allow the user to arrange different materials for the digital model, the corresponding UI can be applied to provide possible material options when the item is selected. This feature is still in the process of development.</p>
<h3 id="Spatial-Understanding"><a href="#Spatial-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="Spatial Understanding"></a>Spatial Understanding</h3><p>In interior design scenarios, the real world can be restrictive to the design, so it is also important to detect the actual environment and correspond to the virtual space. Microsoft provides a real-time spatial detection plugin that can determine walls and planes in the environment. However, its drawback lies in the inability to accurately detect small surfaces and transparent objects, and it requires excessive computation, so this is not the most ideal solution. The alternative is to use the hololens device’s environment modeling function to obtain data of the environment in advance, and place it into the virtual setup, which can make the interaction process more effective and responsive to the environment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/thesisrep/1/spatial.png" alt="spatial"></p>
<h3 id="Speech-Recognition"><a href="#Speech-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Speech Recognition"></a>Speech Recognition</h3><p>By applying the speech recognition, we can convert the speech to text in real time. I tried both speech recognition and keyword detection. Speech recognition converts all voice over a period of time into text, enabling developers to perform text-based processing based on it, but this approach takes up significant memory and computation power. If keyword detection is used, it can identify whether predefined keywords are referred to and we can then determine the meaning of the language based on the order the keywords recognized. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is not scalable. In the scope of thesis, we need to allocate more arithmetic power to achieve speedy responses, so I will keep trying use keyword detection to identify the intent behind user conversations.</p>
<h2 id="Experiment-Design"><a href="#Experiment-Design" class="headerlink" title="Experiment Design"></a>Experiment Design</h2><p>A participant with no interior design skills and a designer were placed together in an empty room of about 40 m2. They were given 5 minutes to experience the CoDeAR tutorial and familiarize themselves with the interactions. The participant is then asked to try to design a room for themselves in collaboration with the designer within 20 minutes. The program would record the participants’ movements, interactions and keyword trigger times. At the end of the experiment, a 15-minute semi-structured interview was conducted to understand the participants’ attitudes towards AR-assisted design collaboration, interaction methods, and recommendation systems. </p>
<h3 id="Expected-Outcome"><a href="#Expected-Outcome" class="headerlink" title="Expected Outcome"></a>Expected Outcome</h3><p>The main focus of the experiment was whether users found the prototype interactions easy to learn and use, whether they found it comfortable to communicate with designers, and how they felt about the involvement of computer intelligence.</p>
