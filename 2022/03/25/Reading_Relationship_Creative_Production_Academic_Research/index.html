project-based art and research contribute to each other:\n\n\nDoing research through practice is not something new in terms of the sociology of science\n\nProblem: artistic research builds on “what is ultimately a very narrow understanding of what artistic work is”(p11)\n\nRomanticism in art work: “the “truth” about the artist’s work is hidden in the deep layers of the mind of the artist rather than in what is observable and explainable”(p12)\n\nAuthor’s idea: makes a plea for “reframing artistic research to make it useful as a form of research and interesting enough for those in the scholarly community”(p12).\n\nThe problem of romanticism: “no outsider can evaluate” the artwork, “the framework cannot be verified through research”(p12), hard to “learn from a work like this and apply this learning in one’s work”(p13)\n\nAuthor’s idea of study art: by watching closely, describing, learning and seeing how “fixes” are made and how ideas evolve (p13)\n\nThe key methodological trick in sociology of science : description. “putting complex practice into words”(p13)\n\nResearch on practice: “practice was made into a topic of research, not something that is only interesting because of some deeper, underlying meaning”(p13).  – but can be hard to read for those has no related experience.\n\nEthical danger of “making art into something esoteric, something beyond logic”:(p16)\n\nAnalytically break art into parts while simultaneously criticizing such analytic breakdowns\nAdd another bias to our research practice\n\n\nProduction of new knowledge : one of the central requirements of academic research\n\nProduction of new artifacts : key characteristic of creative practice in art and design\n\nKey question of this negotiation research and practice: “how the production of artifacts can contribute to the production of knowledge”(p59)\n\nAuthor’s concentrate: the relationship between the production of artifacts and the production of knowledge in research “with regard to the inclusion of tacit knowledge” (p60)\n\nDefinition of research: “a formal, systematic and rigorous process of inquiry”, “the purpose of which is to gain new knowledge or understanding”(p60)\n\nTacit knowledge is both important and problematic for research:\n\nfor experiential knowledge and connoisseurship : tacit knowledge can be used and developed as part of research, “although it evades the conventional textual communication and argumentation, and thus wider dissemination”(p61)\nfor aesthetic evaluation and judgment: tacit knowledge plays an important role “both within the research process and in evaluating and communicating research outcomes”(p62)\n\n\nThe problem of tacit knowledge in research\n\nprioritization of propositional knowledge: the failure to acknowledge this prioritization(p63)\ncommunication of tacit knowledge: some part of practice knowledge “cannot be made explicit by verbal/textual means”(p63), always personal and situated\n\n\nMost important stage in research: knowledge generation and knowledge communication\n\nSome of this knowledge is propositional and explicit, other knowledge that is brought in from practice is experientially based and tacit.(p63)\n\nThe form of communication will vary:\n\nProblems of a theoretical nature: verbal and/or textual language\nProcess-related problems: passing experience on indirectly through empathy (p64)\nObject-related problems: evoke the relevant experience through use of the actual object (p65)\n\n\nArtifacts in the process of knowledge communication: (p66)\n\nIndicative of process knowledge that can be read from the object that is the result of the research through marks, joints\nUsed to illustrate a problem\nUsed for demonstration proposes\nPresented as the evidence of an explanation to find new avenues\nTo convey a certain experience\n\n\nCreative production “can be understood as contributing to the fulfillment of the conditions of research” in different ways(p69)\n\nDefining of research: “An activity is research if and only if it is 1) a systematic investigation, 2) conducted intentionally, 3) to acquire new knowledge, understanding, insights, etc., that is 4) justified and 5) communicated 6) about a subject.”(p71)\n\nDescriptions of practice-based research : the whole debate surrounding practice-based art and design research “can be viewed as not being about a type of research, but about how creative production functions in research”(p74)\n\nArt and design as the subject of research: “unless the principles and practices of creative production are involved in the research in some substantive way, there is little reason for characterizing this as practice-based research.”(p75)\nArt and design as method of inquiry: At its weakest, it is a claim for art and design as procedure employed in research(p75). A stronger claim is for creative production as method, in the sense of tool or technique, within an established research methodology.(p76)\nArt and design as communication and justification of research outcomes: “the use of the visual” and the objects are “communicative forms of knowledge and understanding”(p76)\nArt and design as a/the goal of inquiry: to make this tacit knowledge explicit, justification and communication of the knowledge acquired(p77)\n\n\n\nReflection:\nThis article discusses why we need art research, tacit knowledge in art research and the role of art practice in research. I respectfully agree with one of the points: because we need to build consensus about art that generates new knowledge or provokes critical discussion, the study of art should be verifiable and can be evaluated and learned from. The article mentions the concept of tacit knowledge, and I think that with the development of media technology we will have more ways to disseminate this knowledge maybe beyond language and text, thus making it less of a problem in research.\nQuestions:\nHow to make research about tacit knowledge easy to understand and discuss? As mentioned in the research about the study of piano performance, this seems difficult.\nIs it possible for artistic practice to have multiple roles in the conditions of research? Such as both the method and the goal of the inquiry.\n","dateCreated":"2022-03-25T08:49:00-04:00","dateModified":"2022-05-11T15:53:03-04:00","datePublished":"2022-03-25T08:49:00-04:00","description":"Summary:How project-based art and research contribute to each other:","headline":"Reading - On the Relationship between Creative Production and Academic Research","image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://example.com/2022/03/25/Reading_Relationship_Creative_Production_Academic_Research/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yuechen Wang","sameAs":["https://github.com/","http://stackoverflow.com/users","https://twitter.com/","https://facebook.com/","https://plus.google.com/","https://www.linkedin.com/profile/","mailto"],"image":"author.jpg","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"author.jpg"}},"url":"http://example.com/2022/03/25/Reading_Relationship_Creative_Production_Academic_Research/","keywords":"reading"}</script>

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>How project-based art and research contribute to each other:</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<ul>
<li><p>Doing research through practice is not something new in terms of the sociology of science</p>
</li>
<li><p>Problem: artistic research builds on “what is ultimately a very narrow understanding of what artistic work is”(p11)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Romanticism in art work: “the “truth” about the artist’s work is hidden in the deep layers of the mind of the artist rather than in what is observable and explainable”(p12)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Author’s idea: makes a plea for “reframing artistic research to make it useful as a form of research and interesting enough for those in the scholarly community”(p12).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The problem of romanticism: “no outsider can evaluate” the artwork, “the framework cannot be verified through research”(p12), hard to “learn from a work like this and apply this learning in one’s work”(p13)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Author’s idea of study art: by watching closely, describing, learning and seeing how “fixes” are made and how ideas evolve (p13)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The key methodological trick in sociology of science : description. “putting complex practice into words”(p13)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Research on practice: “practice was made into a topic of research, not something that is only interesting because of some deeper, underlying meaning”(p13).  – but can be hard to read for those has no related experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ethical danger of “making art into something esoteric, something beyond logic”:(p16)</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytically break art into parts while simultaneously criticizing such analytic breakdowns</li>
<li>Add another bias to our research practice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Production of new knowledge : one of the central requirements of academic research</p>
</li>
<li><p>Production of new artifacts : key characteristic of creative practice in art and design</p>
</li>
<li><p>Key question of this negotiation research and practice: “how the production of artifacts can contribute to the production of knowledge”(p59)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Author’s concentrate: the relationship between the production of artifacts and the production of knowledge in research “with regard to the inclusion of tacit knowledge” (p60)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Definition of research: “a formal, systematic and rigorous process of inquiry”, “the purpose of which is to gain new knowledge or understanding”(p60)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tacit knowledge is both important and problematic for research:</p>
<ul>
<li>for experiential knowledge and connoisseurship : tacit knowledge can be used and developed as part of research, “although it evades the conventional textual communication and argumentation, and thus wider dissemination”(p61)</li>
<li>for aesthetic evaluation and judgment: tacit knowledge plays an important role “both within the research process and in evaluating and communicating research outcomes”(p62)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The problem of tacit knowledge in research</p>
<ul>
<li>prioritization of propositional knowledge: the failure to acknowledge this prioritization(p63)</li>
<li>communication of tacit knowledge: some part of practice knowledge “cannot be made explicit by verbal/textual means”(p63), always personal and situated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Most important stage in research: knowledge generation and knowledge communication</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some of this knowledge is propositional and explicit, other knowledge that is brought in from practice is experientially based and tacit.(p63)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The form of communication will vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems of a theoretical nature: verbal and/or textual language</li>
<li>Process-related problems: passing experience on indirectly through empathy (p64)</li>
<li>Object-related problems: evoke the relevant experience through use of the actual object (p65)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Artifacts in the process of knowledge communication: (p66)</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicative of process knowledge that can be read from the object that is the result of the research through marks, joints</li>
<li>Used to illustrate a problem</li>
<li>Used for demonstration proposes</li>
<li>Presented as the evidence of an explanation to find new avenues</li>
<li>To convey a certain experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Creative production “can be understood as contributing to the fulfillment of the conditions of research” in different ways(p69)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Defining of research: “An activity is research if and only if it is 1) a systematic investigation, 2) conducted intentionally, 3) to acquire new knowledge, understanding, insights, etc., that is 4) justified and 5) communicated 6) about a subject.”(p71)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Descriptions of practice-based research : the whole debate surrounding practice-based art and design research “can be viewed as not being about a type of research, but about how creative production functions in research”(p74)</p>
<ul>
<li>Art and design as the subject of research: “unless the principles and practices of creative production are involved in the research in some substantive way, there is little reason for characterizing this as practice-based research.”(p75)</li>
<li>Art and design as method of inquiry: At its weakest, it is a claim for art and design as procedure employed in research(p75). A stronger claim is for creative production as method, in the sense of tool or technique, within an established research methodology.(p76)</li>
<li>Art and design as communication and justification of research outcomes: “the use of the visual” and the objects are “communicative forms of knowledge and understanding”(p76)</li>
<li>Art and design as a/the goal of inquiry: to make this tacit knowledge explicit, justification and communication of the knowledge acquired(p77)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
<p>This article discusses why we need art research, tacit knowledge in art research and the role of art practice in research. I respectfully agree with one of the points: because we need to build consensus about art that generates new knowledge or provokes critical discussion, the study of art should be verifiable and can be evaluated and learned from. The article mentions the concept of tacit knowledge, and I think that with the development of media technology we will have more ways to disseminate this knowledge maybe beyond language and text, thus making it less of a problem in research.</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<p>How to make research about tacit knowledge easy to understand and discuss? As mentioned in the research about the study of piano performance, this seems difficult.</p>
<p>Is it possible for artistic practice to have multiple roles in the conditions of research? Such as both the method and the goal of the inquiry.</p>
