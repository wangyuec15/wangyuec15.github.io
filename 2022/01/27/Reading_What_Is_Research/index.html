There are several definitions mentioned by the interviewers:\n\n\nSystematic Questioning and Inquiry\nProducing New Knowledge\nCreative Activity and Scholarship\nExploration and Discovery\nInvestigation of a Subject Area, Experimentation, and Making\nIntegration and Technique\nInstitutional Complexity\nA Process That Means Different Things to Different People\n\nThe prevalence by discipline and definition is analyzed:\n\nThose from Engineering, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences background would vote more for “Producing New Knowledge.”\nSimilar proportion from each discipline supported research is “Systematic Questioning and Inquiry”, “Exploration and Discovery” or “Integration and Technique.”\nRespondents with Engineering and Arts background has a lower proportion to describe research as “Creative Activity and Scholarship”\nThose whose primary disciplines included the Fine Arts clusters had the highest proportion of “Investigation and Making.”\nPeople from Music, Theatre, and Dance would spoke least about research as “Institutional Complexity”, and most about “A Process that Means Different Things for Different People.”\n\nI found it inspiring to see how those researchers reflecting on their experience to support their definitions of research. There are different research methods ,objectives and institutions of different research disciplines, they influences the way people conduct and think of their research. For example, the difference between “basic” and “applied” research. The idea “a PhD were more likely to suggest that research involves ‘Systematic Questioning and Inquiry’” is also interesting, I would like to support “error, reframing, and a constant refinement of questions based on the answers gained through the process” is necessary ability for the researchers and can be improved through the academic training for PHD.\nIn What Is Art Research, the university faculty, staff and students contributes to the seven topics of art research:\n\nPractice-Led\nCreating and Disseminating New Culture\nHumanistic Scholarship and Social Scientific Research About The Arts\nHuman-Centered\nThe Arts and Design: In The Context and Culture of Academic Research\nEngagement\nDesign Research\n\nThis report based on the idea from What Is Research that research “can mean different things to different people”, for art research is broadly defined.\nAs a student from a design background, I would support art research is practice-led, but I also have the confusion as mentioned in one interview in the article, that “here are no measures for rigor or relevance or quality”(8) to convince a practitioner to become a researcher. Human-centered would be the most inspiring topic I found in this article, for it emphasizes the difference between art research and scientific research, that artists conduct better research by being involved and reflective meanwhile scientists should better be objective.\nQuestion:\nIn the article What Is Art Research, it mentioned a topic “Creating and Disseminating New Culture”, through artists’ critique and engagement with the world, motivate people to change and shift the way they live or experience. It reminded me of the Arts and Crafts Movement in last century, when art research not yet developed. Now that we are going to conduct art research, how would we do better in terms of creating new culture? what is our greatest strength?\n","dateCreated":"2022-01-27T01:00:48-05:00","dateModified":"2022-05-11T15:07:58-04:00","datePublished":"2022-01-27T01:00:48-05:00","description":"In What Is Research? , the question is answered by researchers in different fields and positions.

        <div class="main-content-wrap">
            <p>In <em>What Is Research?</em> , the question is answered by researchers in different fields and positions. There are several definitions mentioned by the interviewers:</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<ul>
<li>Systematic Questioning and Inquiry</li>
<li>Producing New Knowledge</li>
<li>Creative Activity and Scholarship</li>
<li>Exploration and Discovery</li>
<li>Investigation of a Subject Area, Experimentation, and Making</li>
<li>Integration and Technique</li>
<li>Institutional Complexity</li>
<li>A Process That Means Different Things to Different People</li>
</ul>
<p>The prevalence by discipline and definition is analyzed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those from Engineering, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences background would vote more for “Producing New Knowledge.”</li>
<li>Similar proportion from each discipline supported research is “Systematic Questioning and Inquiry”, “Exploration and Discovery” or “Integration and Technique.”</li>
<li>Respondents with Engineering and Arts background has a lower proportion to describe research as “Creative Activity and Scholarship”</li>
<li>Those whose primary disciplines included the Fine Arts clusters had the highest proportion of “Investigation and Making.”</li>
<li>People from Music, Theatre, and Dance would spoke least about research as “Institutional Complexity”, and most about “A Process that Means Different Things for Different People.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I found it inspiring to see how those researchers reflecting on their experience to support their definitions of research. There are different research methods ,objectives and institutions of different research disciplines, they influences the way people conduct and think of their research. For example, the difference between “basic” and “applied” research. The idea “a PhD were more likely to suggest that research involves ‘Systematic Questioning and Inquiry’” is also interesting, I would like to support “error, reframing, and a constant refinement of questions based on the answers gained through the process” is necessary ability for the researchers and can be improved through the academic training for PHD.</p>
<p>In <em>What Is Art Research</em>, the university faculty, staff and students contributes to the seven topics of art research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice-Led</li>
<li>Creating and Disseminating New Culture</li>
<li>Humanistic Scholarship and Social Scientific Research About The Arts</li>
<li>Human-Centered</li>
<li>The Arts and Design: In The Context and Culture of Academic Research</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Design Research</li>
</ul>
<p>This report based on the idea from What Is Research that research “can mean different things to different people”, for art research is broadly defined.</p>
<p>As a student from a design background, I would support art research is practice-led, but I also have the confusion as mentioned in one interview in the article, that “here are no measures for rigor or relevance or quality”(8) to convince a practitioner to become a researcher. Human-centered would be the most inspiring topic I found in this article, for it emphasizes the difference between art research and scientific research, that artists conduct better research by being involved and reflective meanwhile scientists should better be objective.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>In the article What Is Art Research, it mentioned a topic “Creating and Disseminating New Culture”, through artists’ critique and engagement with the world, motivate people to change and shift the way they live or experience. It reminded me of the Arts and Crafts Movement in last century, when art research not yet developed. Now that we are going to conduct art research, how would we do better in terms of creating new culture? what is our greatest strength?</p>
